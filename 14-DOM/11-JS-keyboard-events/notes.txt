When you interact with the keyboard, the keyboard events are fired. There are three main keyboard events:

- keydown – fires when you press a key on the keyboard and fires repeatedly while you’re holding down the key.
- keyup – fires when you release a key on the keyboard.
- keypress – fires when you press a character keyboard like a,b, or c, not the left arrow key, home, or end keyboard, … The keypress also fires repeatedly while you hold down the key on the keyboard.

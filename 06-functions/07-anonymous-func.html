    <h1>Anonymous functions</h1>
    <p>Note that if you don't place the anonymous function inside the (), you'll get a syntax error. The () makes the anonymous function an expression that returns a function object.</p>
    <p>An anonymous function is not accessible after its initial creation. Therefore, you often need to assign it to a variable.</p>

        let show = function(){

        };

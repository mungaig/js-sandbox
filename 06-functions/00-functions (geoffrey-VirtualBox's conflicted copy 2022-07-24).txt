functions are reusable blocks of code
functions that are part of objects are called methods
Some functions require parameters to be specified when you are invoking them also known as arguments, properties or even attributes.
When you need to specify multiple parameters, they are separated by commas.
We declare functions listing their parameters, then call them passing arguments.
Functions are actions. So their name is usually a verb. It should be brief, as accurate as possible and describe what the function does.
A function is a value, so we can deal with it as a value.

Difference between a function declaration and function expression.
*** A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.
*** A Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined.

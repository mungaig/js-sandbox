functions are reusable blocks of code
functions that are part of objects are called methods
Some functions require parameters to be specified when you are invoking them also known as arguments, properties or even attributes.
When you need to specify multiple parameters, they are separated by commas.
We declare functions listing their parameters, then call them passing arguments.
Functions are actions. So their name is usually a verb. It should be brief, as accurate as possible and describe what the function does.
A function is a value, so we can deal with it as a value.
A function is a value representing an action.
Regular values like strings or numbers represent the data
We can pass a function between variables and run when we want.
